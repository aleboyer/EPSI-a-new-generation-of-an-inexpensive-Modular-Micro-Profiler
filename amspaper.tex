\abstract{Scripps once again has the capability to make microstructure measurements.  I’ll present early results from the epsilometer or “epsi,” a new instrument our group has built for low-power, inexpensive and modular measurements of turbulence.  It’s designed to be deployed from autonomous, towed or dropped platforms, and has greatly reduced the complexity and cost of such measurements, which are crucial for understanding a variety of physical processes in the ocean}
